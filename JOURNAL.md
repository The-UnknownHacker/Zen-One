# July 7th: Started the project

Today I started the table. The first thing to do before I start is to write a summary of what feautures I want so I know what to design

Some Features I was thinking are
- Stable 4 leg desk - This is to ensure it doesnt shake or wobble like a 2 legged desk
- Have a wireless charging station on the left or right - This should include wireless chargers for all my gadgets and more
- Built in configurable LEDS using an ESP32 to control neopixels
- Have tons of light configurable storage
- Have an Ikea Skadis at the back panel

For now this is all I want to implement but I want to make the table modular so I can keep adding new features

Now after laying down the requirements it was time to start CAD

Before starting CAD I took down some measurements and decided on wanting a size of 2400 MM for the length and 900mm for the width as this is a nice size
I found the cheapest and best quality wood at a local store here. I need to buy 2 of these as one for the table top and one for the back

After this I created a simple rectangle with the dimensions I wanted in CAD and this is my result

After this I extruded it by the tables height to get a table top of 2400mmx900mmx17mm

After this it was time to find some good and sturdy legs. After doing some research I decided on using 4 stable legs with a 90mmx45mmx750mm for the legs

To cover all 4 legs I need to buy 3 of these as that gives me around 9 legs but I need to double them up so 4 legs in total

After adding the legs and extruding them to height I got something like this

I then added a back panel to get something like this

The problem with this is that it is NOT stable at all and to fix this I can add diagonal metal bars along with 3d printed support brackets
